### Description

VoterHub is a PERN-stack application that allows anyone in the U.S. to easily see details and contact information for every elected official who represents them at every level of government from local to federal, based on U.S. address, as well as voter information and resources such as links to register to vote in the user's state, find polling locations, and contact local election officials. Users can also sign up and save their own private notes on each representative and on their voter information.
